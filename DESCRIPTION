Description: Includes functions to compute dispersal variance, population growth 
    rate in favorable habitats, the maximum linear infrastructure
    density and the minimum size of a habitat patch delimited by linear
    infrastructures beyond which populations cannot persist, a spatially-implicit
    stochastic age-structured model and a spatially-explicit individual-based
    model of population dynamics. 
    This package can be used to assess the impact of linear infrastructures in 
    general - such as roads, railways, wind farms, power lines, water channels -, 
    on populations, although the functions and models included were initially 
    developed for studying the impact of roads.
